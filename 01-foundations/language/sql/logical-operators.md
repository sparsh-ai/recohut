# SQL Logical Operators

You'll likely also want to filter data using several conditions---possibly more often than you'll want to filter by only one condition. Logical operators allow you to use multiple comparison operators in one query.

Each logical operator is a special snowflake, so we'll go through them individually in the following lessons. Here's a quick preview:

- `LIKE` allows you to match similar values, instead of exact values.
- `IN` allows you to specify a list of values you'd like to include.
- `BETWEEN` allows you to select only rows within a certain range.
- `IS NULL` allows you to select rows that contain no data in a given column.
- `AND` allows you to select only rows that satisfy two conditions.
- `OR` allows you to select rows that satisfy either of two conditions.
- `NOT` allows you to select rows that do not match a certain condition.
