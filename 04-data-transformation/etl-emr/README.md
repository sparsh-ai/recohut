## Note

### EMR Serverless

Amazon EMR Serverless  is a new deployment option for Amazon EMR. EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies the operation of analytics applications that use the latest open source frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With EMR Serverless, you don’t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run applications with these frameworks.

EMR Serverless  helps you avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources for your data processing jobs. EMR Serverless automatically determines the resources that the application needs, gets these resources to process your jobs, and releases the resources when the jobs finish. For use cases where applications need a response within seconds, such as interactive data analysis, you can pre-initialize the resources that the application needs when you create the application.

With EMR Serverless, you'll continue to get the benefits of Amazon EMR, such as open source compatibility, concurrency, and optimized runtime performance for popular frameworks.

EMR Serverless is suitable for customers who want ease in operating applications using open source frameworks. It offers quick job startup, automatic capacity management, and straightforward cost controls.
