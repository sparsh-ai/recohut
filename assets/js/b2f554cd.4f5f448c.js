Use `LISTAGG` for `STUFF` - you need to left join the tables with LISTAGG for each STUFF statement\\n2. Remove `[]` brackets\\n3. Use `IFNULL` for `ISNULL`\\n4. `CONCAT` works better for appending strings compare to `+`\\n5. Use `MONTHNAME` for `DATENAME(month,<>)`, same applies for other date cases\\n6. `CONVERT` doesn\'t work, you would need to write custom logic for it (sorry, no direct keyword here!)\\n\\nI am sure there are more rules we can list out here, but in my view, these were the only rules I needed to apply to migrate my view.

And deep learning is gaining traction as the preferred choice for model architecture. Giants like Google and Facebook are already using recommenders to earn billions of dollars.\\n\\nRecently, Facebook shared its approach to maintain its 12 trillion parameter recommender. Building these large systems is challenging because it requires huge computation and memory resources. And we will soon enter into 100 trillion range. And SMEs will not be left behind due to open-source environment of software architectures and the decreasing cost of hardware, especially on the cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nAs per one estimate, a model with 100 trillion parameters would require at least 200TB just to store the model, even at 16-bit floating-point accuracy. So we need architectures that can support efficient and distributed training of recommendation models.\\n\\n***Memory-intensive vs Computation-intensive***: The increasing parameter comes mostly from the embedding layer which maps each entrance of an ID type feature (such as an user ID and a session ID) into a fixed length low-dimensional embedding vector. Consider the billion scale of entrances for the ID type features in a production recommender system and the wide utilization of feature crosses, the embedding layer usually domains the parameter space, which makes this component extremely **memory-intensive**. On the other hand, these low-dimensional embedding vectors are concatenated with diversified Non-ID type features (e.g., image, audio, video, social network, etc.) to feed a group of increasingly sophisticated neural networks (e.g., convolution, LSTM, multi-head attention) for prediction(s). Furthermore, in practice, multiple objectives can also be combined and optimized simultaneously for multiple tasks. These mechanisms make the rest neural network increasingly **computation-intensive**.\\n\\n![An example of a recommender models with 100+ trillions of parameter in the embedding layer and 50+ TFLOP computation in the neural network.](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-distributed-training-of-recommender-systems-untitled.png)\\n\\nAn example of a recommender models with 100+ trillions of parameter in the embedding layer and 50+ TFLOP computation in the neural network.\\n\\n[Alibaba\'s XDL](https://github.com/alibaba/x-deeplearning), [Baidu\'s PaddleRec](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleRec), and [Kwai\'s Persia](https://github.com/persiaml/persia) are some open-source frameworks for this large-scale distributed training of recommender systems.\\n\\n<aside>\\n\ud83d\udccc ***Synchronous vs Asynchronous Algorithms***: Synchronous algorithms always use the up-to-date gradient to update the model to ensure the model accuracy. However, the overhead of communications for synchronous algorithms starts to become too expensive to scale out the training procedure, causing inefficiency in running time. While asynchronous algorithm have better hardware efficiency, it often leads to a \u201csignificant\u201d loss in model accuracy at this scale\u2014for production recommender systems (e.g., Baidu\u2019s search engine). Recall that even 0.1% drop of accuracy would lead to a noticeable loss in revenue.\\n\\n</aside>\\n\\n### Parameter Server Framework\\n\\nExisting distributed systems for deep learning based recommender models are usually built on top of the parameter server (PS) framework, where one can add elastic distributed storage to hold the increasingly large amount of parameters of the embedding layer. On the other hand, the computation workload does not scale linearly with the increasing parameter scale of the embedding layer\u2014in fact, with an efficient implementation, a lookup operation over a larger embedding table would introduce almost no additional computations.\\n\\n![Left: deep learning based recommender model training workflow over a heterogeneous cluster.

Each module can be dynamically scaled for different model scales and desired training throughput:\\n\\n- A data loader that fetches training data from distributed storages such as Hadoop, Kafka, etc;\\n- A embedding parameter server (embedding PS for short) manages the storage and update of the parameters in the embedding layer $\\\\mathrm{w}^{emb}$;\\n- A group of embedding workers that runs Algorithm 1 for getting the embedding parameters from the embedding PS; aggregating embedding vectors (potentially) and putting embedding gradients back to embedding PS;\\n- A group of NN workers that runs the forward-/backward- propagation of the neural network $\\\\mathrm{NN_{w^{nn}}(\xb7)}$.\\n\\n![The architecture of Persia.](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-distributed-training-of-recommender-systems-untitled-4.png)\\n\\nThe architecture of Persia.\\n\\nLogically, the training procedure is conducted by Persia in a data dispatching based paradigm as below:\\n\\n1. The data loader will dispatch the ID type feature $\\\\mathrm{x^{ID}}$ to an embedding worker\u2014the embedding worker will generate an unique sample ID \ud835\udf09 for this sample, buffer this sample ID with the ID type feature $\\\\mathrm{x_\\\\xi^{ID}}$ locally, and returns this ID \ud835\udf09 back the data loader; the data loader will associate this sample\u2019s Non-ID type features and labels with this unique ID.\\n2. Next, the data loader will dispatch the Non-ID type feature and label(s) $\\\\mathrm{(x_\\\\xi^{NID},y_\\\\xi)}$ to a NN worker.\\n3. Once a NN worker receives this incomplete training sample, it will issue a request to pull the ID type features\u2019 $\\\\mathrm{(x_\\\\xi^{ID})}$ embedding $\\\\mathrm{w_\\\\xi^{emb}}$ from some embedding worker according to the sample ID \ud835\udf09\u2014this would trigger the forward propagation in Algorithm 1, where the embedding worker will use the buffered ID type feature $\\\\mathrm{x_\\\\xi^{ID}}$ to get the corresponding $\\\\mathrm{w_\\\\xi^{emb}}$ from the embedding PS.\\n4. Then the embedding worker performs some potential aggregation of original embedding vectors. When this computation finishes, the aggregated embedding vector $\\\\mathrm{w_\\\\xi^{emb}}$ will be transmitted to the NN worker that issues the pull request.\\n5. Once the NN worker gets a group of complete inputs for the dense module, it will create a mini-batch and conduct the training computation of the NN according to Algorithm 2. Note that the parameter of the NN always locates in the device RAM of the NN worker, where the NN workers synchronize the gradients by the AllReduce Paradigm.\\n6. When the iteration of Algorithm 2 is finished, the NN worker will send the gradients of the embedding ($\\\\mathrm{F_\\\\xi^{emb\'}}$) back to the embedding worker (also along with the sample ID \ud835\udf09).\\n7. The embedding worker will query the buffered ID type feature $\\\\mathrm{x_\\\\xi^{ID}}$ according to the sample ID \ud835\udf09; compute gradients $\\\\mathrm{F_\\\\xi^{emb\'}}$ of the embedding parameters and send the gradients to the embedding PS, so that the embedding PS can finally compute the updates according the embedding parameter\u2019s gradients by its SGD optimizer and update the embedding parameters."},{"id":"/2021/10/01/document-recommendation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/document-recommendation","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-document-recommendation.mdx","title":"Document Recommendation","description":"/img/content-blog-raw-blog-document-recommendation-untitled.png","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"nlp","permalink":"/blog/tags/nlp"},{"label":"similarity","permalink":"/blog/tags/similarity"}],"readingTime":1.285,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sparsh Agarwal","title":"Data Scientist & Engineer","url":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai","email":"sprsag@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai.png","key":"sparsh"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Document Recommendation","authors":"sparsh","tags":["nlp","similarity"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Distributed Training of Recommender Systems","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/distributed-training-of-recommender-systems"},"nextItem":{"title":"Fake Voice Detection","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/fake-voice-detection"}},"content":"![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-document-recommendation-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-document-recommendation-untitled.png)\\n\\n## **Introduction**\\n\\n### Business objective\\n\\nFor the given user query, recommend relevant documents (BRM_ifam)\\n\\n### Technical objective\\n\\n1-to-N mapping of given input text\\n\\n## **Proposed Framework 1 \u2014 Hybrid Recommender System**\\n\\n- Text \u2192 Vector (Universal Sentence Embedding with TF Hub)\\n- Vector \u2192 Content-based Filtering Recommendation\\n- Index \u2192 Interaction Matrix\\n- Interaction Matrix \u2192 Collaborative Filtering Recommendation\\n- Collaborative + Content-based \u2192 Hybrid Recommendation\\n- Evaluation: Area-under-curve\\n\\n## **Proposed Framework 2 \u2014 Content-based Recommender System**\\n\\n1.

The objective is to differentiate between fake and real voice. Python and deep learning has been used and implemented to achieve the objective. Audio files or video file are being used as an input of this work then model has been trained for uniquely identify features for voice creation and voice detection. Deep learning technique is used to find accuracy between real and fake.\\n\\nSpeaker recognition usually refers to both speaker identification and speaker verification. A speaker identification system identifies who the speaker is, while an automatic speaker verification (ASV) system decides if an identity claim is true or false.\\nA general ASV system is robust to zero-effort impostors, they are\xa0vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. Such vulnerability represents one of the security concerns of ASV systems.\xa0Spoofing involves an adversary (attacker) who masquerades as the target speaker to gain the access to a system.\xa0Such spoofing attacks can happen to various biometric traits, such as fingerprints, iris, face, and voice patterns. We are focusing only on the voice-based spoofing and anti-spoofing techniques for ASV system.\xa0The spoofed speech samples can be obtained through speech synthesis, voice conversion, or replay of recorded speech.\xa0**Imagine the following scenario\u2026**\\nYour phone rings, you pick up. It\u2019s your spouse asking you for details about your savings account \u2014 they don\u2019t have the account information on hand, but want to deposit money there this afternoon. Later, you realize a bunch of money has went missing! After investigating, you find out that the person masquerading as them on the other line was a voice 100% generated with AI. You\u2019ve just been scammed, and on top of that, can\u2019t believe the voice you thought belonged to your spouse was actually a fake.\\n\\nTo discern between real and fake audio, the detector uses visual representations of audio clips called spectrograms, which are also used to train speech synthesis models.\\nGoogle\u2019s 2019\xa0[AVSSpoof dataset](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/advancing-research-fake-audio-detection/)\xa0contains over 25,000 clips of audio, featuring both real and fake clips of a variety of male and female speakers.**Temporal Convolution Model**\\n\\n# Modeling Approach\\n\\nFirst, raw audio is preprocessed and converted into a mel-frequency spectrogram \u2014 this is the input for the model. The model performs convolutions over the time dimension of the spectrogram, then uses masked pooling to prevent overfitting. Finally, the output is passed into a dense layer and a sigmoid activation function, which ultimately outputs a predicted probability between 0 (fake) and 1 (real).\\nThe baseline model achieved 99%, 95%, and 85% accuracy on the train, validation, and test sets respectively. The differing performance is caused by differences between the three datasets. While all three datasets feature distinct and different speakers, the test set uses a different set of fake audio generating algorithms that were not present in the train or validation set.\\n\\n# Proposed Framework\\n\\n# Process Flow\\n\\n- Voice detection\\n    - Temporal Convolution model\\n        - Install packages\\n        - Download pretrained models\\n        - Initialize the model\\n        - Load data\\n        - Detect DeepFakes\\n    - GMM-UBG model\\n        - Install packages\\n        - Train the model\\n        - Load data\\n        - Detect DeepFakes\\n    - Convolutional VAE model\\n        - Install packages\\n        - Train the model\\n        - Load data\\n        - Detect DeepFakes\\n    - Voice Similarity\\n        - Install packages\\n        - Load data\\n        - Voice similarity match\\n        - Embedding visualization\\n\\n# Models Algorithms\\n\\n1.

These models are commonly known as encoders because their job is to encode an image into a feature vector. I analyzed four encoders named 1) MobileNet, 2) EfficientNet, 3) ResNet and 4) [BiT](https://tfhub.dev/google/bit/m-r152x4/1). After basic research, I decided to select BiT model because of its performance and state-of-the-art nature. I selected the BiT-M-50x3 variant of model which is of size 748 MB. More details about this architecture can be found on the official page [here](https://tfhub.dev/google/bit/m-r50x3/1). \\n\\n### Vector Similarity System\\n\\nImages are represented in a fixed-length feature vector format. For the given input vector, we need to find the TopK most similar vectors, keeping the memory efficiency and real-time retrival objective in mind. I explored the most popular techniques and listed down five of them: Annoy, Cosine distance, L1 distance, Locally Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Image Deep Ranking. I selected Annoy because of its fast and efficient nature. More details about Annoy can be found on the official page [here](https://github.com/spotify/annoy).\\n\\n### Dataset\\n\\nI listed down 3 datasets from Kaggle that were best fitting the criteria of this use case: 1) [Fashion Product Images (Small)](https://www.kaggle.com/bhaskar2443053/fashion-small?), 2) [Food-11 image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/food11-image-dataset?) and 3) [Caltech 256 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/caltech256?).

Categorize these images into their respective category directories. Make sure that images are of the same type, JPEG recommended. We will also process the metadata and store it in a serialized file, CSV recommended. \\n\\n### Step 2: Encoder Fine-tuning\\n\\nDownload the pre-trained image model and add two additional layers on top of that: the first layer is a feature vector layer and the second layer is the classification layer. We will only train these 2 layers on our data and after training, we will select the feature vector layer as the output of our fine-tuned encoder. After fine-tuning the model, we will save the feature extractor for later use.\\n\\n![Fig: a screenshot of encoder fine-tuning process](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-image-similarity-system-untitled-1.png)\\n\\nFig: a screenshot of encoder fine-tuning process\\n\\n### Step 3: Image Vectorization\\n\\nNow, we will use the encoder (prepared in step 2) to encode the images (prepared in step 1). We will save feature vector of each image as an array in a directory. After processing, we will save these embeddings for later use.\\n\\n### Step 4: Metadata and Indexing\\n\\nWe will assign a unique id to each image and create dictionaries to locate information of this image: 1) Image id to Image name dictionary, 2) Image id to image feature vector dictionary, and 3) (optional) Image id to metadata product id dictionary. We will also create an image id to image feature vector indexing. Then we will save these dictionaries and index object for later use.\\n\\n### Step 5: API Call\\n\\nWe will receive an image from user, encode it with our image encoder, find TopK similar vectors using Indexing object, and retrieve the image (and metadata) using dictionaries. We send these images (and metadata) back to the user.\\n\\n# Deployment\\n\\nThe API was deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk service.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-image-similarity-system-untitled-2.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-image-similarity-system-untitled-2.png)"},{"id":"/2021/10/01/insurance-personalization","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/insurance-personalization","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-insurance-personalization.mdx","title":"Insurance Personalization","description":"Author: Alexsoft","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"insurance","permalink":"/blog/tags/insurance"},{"label":"personalization","permalink":"/blog/tags/personalization"}],"readingTime":9.355,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sparsh Agarwal","title":"Data Scientist & Engineer","url":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai","email":"sprsag@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai.png","key":"sparsh"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Insurance Personalization","authors":"sparsh","tags":["insurance","personalization"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Image Similarity System","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/image-similarity-system"},"nextItem":{"title":"Name & Address Parsing","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/name-&-address-parsing"}},"content":"Author: [Alexsoft](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/personalized-insurance/)\\n\\nIn a hyper-connected world, where advanced analytics and smart devices constantly re-assess and monitor risks, the traditional once-a-year insurance policy looks increasingly irrelevant and static. Insurance will become a breathing and living thing that shrinks and scales with time to accommodate the changing risks in the clients\u2019 daily lives. As technology continues to expand, real-time data from connected devices and predictive analysis from AIs and machine learning will enhance personalized insurance to benefit the client and insurer.\\n\\nTo satisfy the expectations of clients, insurers may need to go beyond the personalization of marketing communication and start personalizing product bundles for individuals.\\n\\n## What is personalized insurance?\\n\\n**Personalized insurance**\xa0is the process of reaching insurance customers with targeted pricing, offers, and messages at the right time. Personalization spans across various types of insurance services, from health to property insurance.\\n\\nSome insurers are already defining themselves as trusted advisors aiding people in navigating, anticipating, and eliminating risks rather than just paying the compensation when things go wrong.\\n\\nFor example, these companies use customer data from wearable and smart devices to monitor the user\u2019s lifestyle. If the user\u2019s data indicate the emergence of a serious medical condition, they can send the customer content designed to change their detrimental lifestyle or recommend immediate treatment. When the customer stays fit, healthy and does not carry out risky activities, their insurance cost will be decreased.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled.png)\\n\\nInsurers can provide personalization to customers at different levels:\\n\\n- **Personalized product bundles.**\xa0The insurer offers a wide range of products such as health, car, life, and property insurance. So, clients can choose the specific products they want and group them in a bundle.\\n- **Personalized communications.**\xa0Insurers use data collected from smart devices to notify customers about harmful activities and lifestyles. They also send recommendations on lifestyle changes. Some insurers take a step further to provide clients with incentives for a healthy lifestyle.\\n- **Personalized insurance quote.**\xa0Customers are able to adjust the price of their insurance premiums by turning off the ones they don\u2019t need at any time. Some insurers enable automatic quote adjustments depending on customer\u2019s behavior (e.g., driving habits) or lifestyle choices (e.g., exercising).\\n\\n### Why is it important?\\n\\nCollecting and analyzing user data is vital in personalizing products based on individual behavior and preferences. In addition, insurers should use this data to enhance external relationships with their customers and guide their internal processes. This will eventually lead to delightful customer experiences and efficient operations.\\n\\nPersonalized insurance is important for many reasons:\\n\\n**Customers expect personalized treatment.**\xa0Every customer wants to feel special, and the personalization of your services and products will do just that. It will make them stay loyal to you. Moreover, customers are open for personalization. According to the\xa0[Accenture study](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-95/Accenture-2019-Global-Financial-Services-Consumer-Study.pdf#zoom=50), 95 percent of new customers are ready to share their data in exchange for personalized insurance services. And about 58 percent of conservative users would be willing to do so.\\n\\n**Driving more effective sales and increasing revenue.**\xa0Personalization benefits your sales and income in two ways. First, lots of people are ready to share their data with you in exchange for incentives and reduced premiums. Secondly, having access to clients\u2019 data gives you the ability to target people who are already interested in your product, thereby increasing sales and revenue at a lower cost. You will be able to reach your customers at the right time and with the product they need.\\n\\n**Streamlining operations and working with customers more accurately.**\xa0Having an insight into customer preferences and behavior is crucial if you want to provide personalized services. Data obtained from social media activity, fitness trackers, GPS, and other tech can help you serve customers better.\\n\\n## Success stories\\n\\n### Lemonade\\n\\nUse of AI and chatbots to personalize communications. \\n\\nLemonade is a US insurance company that uses Maya \u2013 an AI-powered bot, to collect and analyze customer data. Maya acts as a virtual assistant that gets information, provides quotes, and handles payments. It also has the ability to provide customized answers to user\u2019s questions and even help them make changes to existing policies. Lemonade uses Natural Action Synthesis and Natural Language Processing to ensure that Maya gets smarter the more it chats. This is possible because their machine learning model is retrained almost daily.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-1.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-1.png)\\n\\nOn top of that, the company uses big data analytics to quantify losses and predict risks by placing the client into a risk group and quoting a relevant premium. Customers are grouped according to their risk behaviors. The groups are created using algorithms that collect extensive customer data, such as health conditions.\\n\\n### Cover\\n\\n**[Cover](https://cover.com/)**\xa0is a US-based insurance metasearch company that notifies its clients of price drops for their premiums. Their technology works by scanning the market, looking for discounted and lowered prices of insurance premiums for their clients. Cover blends automation, mobile technology, and expert advice to provide customers with high-quality insurance protection at the best prices.\\n\\nCover compares with policy data and prices from over 30 different insurers. From the start, the customers need to provide answers to some questions, which will be used to match the client with a policy that suits their needs.\\n\\n### Oscar\\n\\n**[Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/)**\xa0is a health insurer that provides its clients with a concierge team of medical professionals who give health advice and help them know if they see the best specialist for their specific health condition. They also help with finding the best doctors that accept Oscar insurance and manage and treat chronic conditions. Also, they set aside a separate concierge team in cases of emergencies that helps with the patient\u2019s discharge and follow-up care.\\n\\nOscar\u2019s mobile app acts as an intermediary between the user and the health system. The platform facilitates the customer\u2019s interaction with their healthcare professionals. Clients can receive their lab reports, medical records, physician recommendations, and virtual care from the app. Oscar has also improved its high-touch services, including telemedicine and an \u201cAsk your concierge\u201d feature that connects users with a health insurance advice team.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-2.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-2.png)\\n\\n### Alllstate\\n\\nAllstate is an auto insurance company that offers personalized car insurance to its customers using telematics programs called Drivewise and Milewise. Drivewise is offered through a mobile app that monitors the customers driving behavior and provides feedback after each drive. Customers also receive incentives for safe driving. From the app interface, clients can check their rewards and driving behavior for the last 100 trips. The customer\u2019s premium is then calculated based on factors like speeding, abrupt braking, and time of the trip. One of the nice things about Drivewise is that even those who do not have an Allstate care insurance policy can participate in this program. Their Milewise program, as the name suggests, lets customers pay insurance based on the miles covered. So, the app monitors the distance covered by the car, and low-mileage drivers can save on insurance.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-3.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-3.png)\\n\\n## How to approach personalization?\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-4.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-insurance-personalization-untitled-4.png)\\n\\nBefore fully investing in personalization, you need to carefully plan your approach. This will ensure you have all the pieces for success, and it will help you follow through with your plan.\\n\\n### Explore existing data\\n\\nHaving customer data is the minimum requirement to provide personalized services. First, you need to envision the type of personalization you want to offer. Then, make sure you have data collection channels that provide you with relevant data needed for your tasks. For instance, some of your documents may contain the required information, and you have to digitize, structure those, or extract specific details for that. So, you should audit your current information and data collection mechanisms to estimate whether you\u2019ll need any additional effort to gather this data. For instance, you may want to use\xa0[intelligent document processing](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/intelligent-document-processing/).\\n\\n### Engage data scientists to make the proof of concept and carry out A/B tests\\n\\nYour vision on personalization may not work for every business model. Or your data quality may be low to reach project feasibility. We\u2019ve talked about that while explaining how to approach\xa0[ROI\xa0calculations\xa0with machine learning projects](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/how-to-estimate-roi-and-costs-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-projects/). So, you need to present the data you have to a data science team to run several experiments and build prototypes. Once they are ready, you can roll out your new algorithms for a subset of customers to run A/B tests. Their results may show that the conventional approaches work better for you or help iterate on your assumptions.\\n\\n### Invest in data infrastructure\\n\\nIf the A/B tests show that personalization will work for your business model, that is where automation comes into play. You can start investing in data infrastructure and\xa0[analytical pipelines](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/data-pipeline-components-and-types/)\xa0to automate data collection and analysis mechanisms.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll need a\xa0[data engineering team](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/what-is-data-engineering-explaining-data-pipeline-data-warehouse-and-data-engineer-role/)\xa0for that. These specialists set up connections with data sources, such as mobile, IoT, and telematics devices, enable automatic data preparation, configure storages, and integrate your infrastructure with business intelligence software that helps explore and visualize data.\\n\\n### Continuously learn your customers\u2019 preferences and needs\\n\\nThe data you collect is only as good as the insights gained from it. That is why it is vital to have a\xa0[comprehensive analytic solution](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/complete-guide-to-business-intelligence-and-analytics-strategy-steps-processes-and-tools/). A high-quality analytic software will transform the data into your most valuable asset. This data will be used to improve product development, make more accurate decisions, and provide personalized services to your customers.\\n\\n### Iterate on your infrastructure and algorithms\\n\\nPersonalization isn\u2019t a one-time project. Whether you apply machine learning or build personalization based on rule-based systems, you still have to revisit your technology, continuously gather new data, and adapt your workflows.\\n\\n### Ensure a personalized cross-channel experience\\n\\nSince the data collected from IoT devices and other tech is vital for personalization, it is important to make the customer experience seamless across different communication channels. Therefore, the customer should always be provided with the same level of personalization regardless of the touchpoint.\\n\\n## Challenges\\n\\n**Personalization is financially intensive.**\xa0The ability of insurers to personalize insurance differs only marginally between marketing communications and products. Most of them, especially startups, do not have the funds to implement advanced technologies like machine learning needed for personalized insurance. However, insurers do not need to start with all the levels of personalization. They can often start by customizing their customer service, gathering data and insights, and then gradually developing towards more complex systems.\\n\\n**Complex process involving multiple parties.**\xa0Also, it is difficult to balance personalization with financial targets, especially when establishing a price for risk. In-depth personalization of insurance must use data analytics from different sources to ensure that personalized offers reflect the client\u2019s needs as well as the profitability and risks implications for the company.\\n\\n**Customer data is heavily regulated.**\xa0Customer data from different sources are subject to industry regulations and privacy concerns. It is often a difficult task to obtain approval from regulators to use this data. Also, customers are becoming more aware of how companies are using their data and approve strict regulations. That is why laws such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have been passed, which gives customers more control over their data. Insurers can address this barrier by explaining to people how their systems work and how personal data is used.

This tool is open-source and free to use. I deployed it with a one-click Heroku service (fig 1). After launching the app, log in with the provided credentials, and create a project (fig 2). Create the labels and upload the dataset (fig 3). Start the annotation process (fig 4). Now after enough annotations (you do not need complete all annotations in one go), go back to projects > edit section and export the data (fig 5). Bring the exported JSON file in python and run the model training code. The whole model will automatically get trained on the new annotations. To make the training faster, you can use Nvidia GPU support.\\n\\n![fig 1: screenshot taken from Doccano\'s github page](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-name-&-address-parsing-untitled-3.png)\\n\\nfig 1: screenshot taken from Doccano\'s github page\\n\\n![fig 2: Doccano\'s deployed app homepage](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-name-&-address-parsing-untitled-4.png)\\n\\nfig 2: Doccano\'s deployed app homepage\\n\\n![fig 3: create the labels.

F1 results for all tags were near perfect (score of 1).  This score will increase further with more labeled data. This model is production-ready.\\n\\n# Inference\\n\\nFor OOR, I directly used the model\'s output for core tagging and created the aggregated tags like recipient (aggregation of name tags) and address (aggregation of address tags like city and state) using simple conditional concatenation. For only Name and only Address inference, I added the dummy address in name text and dummy name in address text. This way, I passed the text in same model and later on filtered the required tags as output. \\n\\n### API\\n\\nI used Flask REST framework in Python to build the API with 3 endpoints.

Streamlit app for various object detection models and use cases\\n4. Detect COCO-80 class objects in videos using TFHub MobileNet SSD model\\n\\n### Use Case 1 -  **Object detection with OpenCV**\\n\\n**Face detection** - We will use the frontal face Haar cascade classifier model to detect faces in the given image. The following function first passes the given image into the classifier model to detect a list of face bounding boxes and then runs a loop to draw a red rectangle box around each detected face in the image:\\n\\n```python\\ndef detect_faces(fix_img):\\n    face_rects = face_classifier.detectMultiScale(fix_img)\\n    for (x, y, w, h) in face_rects:\\n        cv2.rectangle(fix_img,\\n                     (x,y),\\n                     (x+w, y+h),\\n                     (255,0,0),\\n                     10)\\n    return fix_img\\n```\\n\\n**Eyes detection** - The process is almost similar to the face detection process. Instead of frontal face Haar cascade, we will use the eye detection Haar cascade model.\\n\\n![Input image](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-opencv-untitled.png)\\n\\nInput image\\n\\n![detected faces and eyes in the image](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-opencv-untitled-1.png)\\n\\ndetected faces and eyes in the image\\n\\n**Pedestrian detection** - We will use the full-body Haar cascade classifier model for pedestrian detection. We will apply this model to a video this time. The following function will run the model on each frame of the video to detect the pedestrians:\\n\\n```python\\n# While Loop\\nwhile cap.isOpened():\\n    # Read the capture\\n\\t\\tret, frame = cap.read()\\n    # Pass the Frame to the Classifier\\n\\t\\tbodies = body_classifier.detectMultiScale(frame, 1.2, 3)\\n    # if Statement\\n\\t\\tif ret == True:\\n        # Bound Boxes to Identified Bodies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor (x,y,w,h) in bodies:\\n            cv2.rectangle(frame,\\n                         (x,y),\\n                         (x+w, y+h),\\n                         (25,125,225),\\n                         5)\\n            cv2.imshow(\'Pedestrians\', frame) \\n        # Exit with Esc button\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:\\n            break  \\n    # else Statement\\n\\t\\telse:\\n        break\\n    \\n# Release the Capture & Destroy All Windows\\ncap.release()\\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\\n```\\n\\n**Car detection** - The process is almost similar to the pedestrian detection process. Again, we will use this model on a video. Instead of people Haar cascade, we will use the car cascade model.\\n\\n**Car number plate detection** - The process is almost similar to the face and eye detection process. We will use the car number plate cascade model.\\n\\n*You can find the code [here](https://github.com/sparsh-ai/0D7ACA15) on Github.*\\n\\n### Use Case 2 - MobileNet SSD Caffe Pre-trained model\\n\\n*You can play with the live app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/sparsh-ai/streamlit-5a407279/app.py). Souce code is available* [here](https://github.com/sparsh-ai/streamlit-489fbbb7) *on Github.*\\n\\n### Use Case 3 - YOLO Object Detection App\\n\\n*You can play with the live app* [*here](https://share.streamlit.io/sparsh-ai/streamlit-489fbbb7/app.py). Source code is available [here](https://github.com/sparsh-ai/streamlit-5a407279/tree/master) on Github.*\\n\\nThis app can detect COCO 80-classes using three different models - Caffe MobileNet SSD, Yolo3-tiny, and Yolo3. It can also detect faces using two different models - SSD Res10 and OpenCV face detector.  Yolo3-tiny can also detect fires.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-yolo3-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-yolo3-untitled.png)\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-yolo3-untitled-1.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-with-yolo3-untitled-1.png)\\n\\n### Use Case 4 - TFHub MobileNet SSD on Videos\\n\\nIn this section, we will use the MobileNet SSD object detection model from TFHub. We will apply it to videos. We can load the model using the following command:\\n\\n```python\\nmodule_handle = \\"https://tfhub.dev/google/openimages_v4/ssd/mobilenet_v2/1\\"\\ndetector = hub.load(module_handle).signatures[\'default\']\\n```\\n\\nAfter loading the model, we will capture frames using OpenCV video capture method, and pass each frame through the detection model:\\n\\n```python\\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(\'/content/Spectre_opening_highest_for_a_James_Bond_film_in_India.mp4\')\\nfor i in range(1,total_frames,200):\\n    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES,i)\\n    ret,frame = cap.read()\\n    frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\\n    run_detector(detector,frame)\\n```\\n\\nHere are some detected objects in frames: \\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled.png)\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled-1.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled-1.png)\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled-2.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-object-detection-hands-on-exercises-untitled-2.png)\\n\\n*You can find the code [here](https://gist.github.com/sparsh-ai/32ff6fe8c073f6be5d893029e4dc2960) on Github.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Congrats!

For example, if a user subscribed to Netflix one month ago and watching action movies all the time. If we recommend another action movie, there is a high probability that user will click but keeping in mind the long-term user satisfaction and to address the filter bubble bias, we would recommend a comedy movie. Surprisingly, this strategy works!!\\n\\nThe most common metric is ***diversity*** factor but diversity only measures dispersion among recommended items. The better alternative is ***unexpectedness*** factor. It measures deviations of recommended items from user expectations and thus captures the concept of user surprise and allows recommender systems to break from the filter bubble. The goal is to provide novel, surprising and satisfying recommendations. \\n\\nIncluding session-based information into the design of an unexpected recommender system is beneficial. For example, it is more reasonable to recommend the next episode of a TV series to the user who has just finished the first episode, instead of recommending new types of videos to that person. On the other hand, if the user has been binge-watching the same TV series in one night, it is better to recommend something different to him or her.\\n\\n### Model\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-personalized-unexpectedness-in-recommender-systems-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-personalized-unexpectedness-in-recommender-systems-untitled.png)\\n\\n*Overview of the proposed PURS model.

Incremental updating, online learning, local updating and even reinforcement learning can make the recommender system quickly respond to the user\u2018s new behavior, and the premise of these updating strategies is that the sample itself has enough real-time information. In news recommendation system, the typical training sample is the user\u2019s click behavior data.\\n\\n### Why is the real-time nature of the recommendation system important?\\n\\nIntuitively, when users use personalized news applications, users expect to find articles that match their interests faster; when using short video services, they expect to \\"flash\\" content that they are interested in faster; when doing online shopping, I also hope to find the products that I like, faster. All recommendations highlight the word \\"fast\\", which is an intuitive manifestation of the \\"real-time\\" role of the recommendation system.\\n\\nFrom a professional point of view, the real-time performance of the recommendation system is also crucial, which is mainly reflected in the following two aspects:\\n\\n1. **The faster the update speed of the recommendation system is, the more it can reflect the user\'s recent user habits, and the more time-sensitive it can make recommendations to the user.**\\n2. **The faster the recommendation system is updated, the easier it is for the model to find the latest popular data patterns, and the more it can make the model react to find the latest fashion trends.**\\n\\n### The real-time nature of the \\"feature\\" of the recommendation system\\n\\nSuppose a user has watched a 10-minute \\"badminton teaching\\" video in its entirety. Then there is no doubt that the user is interested in the subject of \\"badminton\\". The system hopes to continue to recommend \\"badminton\\" related videos when the user turns the page next time. However, due to the lack of real-time features of the system, the user\u2019s viewing history cannot be fed back to the recommendation system in real time. As a result, the recommendation system learned that the user had watched the video \\"Badminton Teaching\\". It was already half an hour later. Has left the app. This is an example of recommendation failure caused by poor real-time performance of the recommendation system.\\n\\nIt is true that the next time the user opens the application, the recommendation system can use the last user behavior history to recommend \\"badminton\\" related videos, but the recommendation system undoubtedly loses what is most likely to increase user viscosity and increase user retention. opportunity.\\n\\n### The real-time nature of the \\"model\\" of the recommender system\\n\\nNo matter how strong the real-time feature is, the scope of influence is limited to the current user. Compared with the real-time nature of \\"features\\", the real-time nature of the recommendation system model is often considered from a more global perspective . The real-time nature of the feature attempts to describe a person with more accurate features, so that the recommendation system can give a recommendation result that is more in line with the person. The real-time nature of the model hopes to capture new data patterns at the global level faster and discover new trends and relevance.\\n\\nTake, for example, a large number of promotional activities on Double Eleven on an e-commerce website. The real-time nature of the feature will quickly discover the products that the user may be interested in based on the user\'s recent behavior, but will never find the latest preferences of similar users, the latest correlation information between the products, and the trend information of new activities.\\n\\nTo discover such global data changes, the model needs to be updated faster. The most important factor affecting the real-time performance of the model is the training method of the model.\\n\\n1. **Full update -** The most common way of model training is full update.\xa0The model will use all training samples in a certain period of time for retraining, and then replace the \\"outdated\\" model with the new trained model. However, the full update requires a large amount of training samples, so the training time required is longer; and the full update is often performed on offline big data platforms, such as spark+tensorflow, so the data delay is also longer, which leads to the full update It is the worst \\"real-time\\" model update method. In fact, for a model that has been trained, it is enough to learn only the newly added incremental samples, which is called incremental update.\\n2. **Incremental update (Incremental Learning)** - Incremental update only feeds newly added samples to the model for incremental learning . Technically, deep learning models often use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants for learning. The model\'s learning of incremental samples is equivalent to continuing to input incremental samples for gradient descent on the basis of the original samples. Therefore, based on the deep learning model, it is not difficult to change from full update to incremental update. But everything in engineering is a tradeoff, there is never a perfect solution, and incremental updates are no exception. Since only incremental samples are used for learning, the model also converges to the best point of the new sample after multiple epochs, and it is difficult to converge to the global best point of all the original samples + incremental samples. Therefore, in the actual recommendation system, the incremental update and the global update are often combined . After several rounds of incremental update, the global update is performed in a time window with a small business volume, and the model is corrected after the incremental update process. Accumulated errors in. Make trade-offs and trade-offs between \\"real-time performance\\" and \\"global optimization\\".\\n3. **Online learning** - \\"Online learning\\" is a further improvement of \\"incremental update\\", \\"incremental update\\" is to perform incremental update when a batch of new samples is obtained, and online learning is to update the model in real time every time a new sample is obtained. Online learning can also be implemented technically through SGD. But if you use the general SGD method, online learning will cause a very serious problem, that is, the sparsity of the model is very poor, opening too many \\"fragmented\\" unimportant features. We pay attention to the \\"sparseness\\" of the model in a sense that is also an engineering consideration. For example, in a model with an input vector of several million dimensions, if the sparsity of the model is good, the effect of the model can be maintained without affecting the model. , Only make the corresponding weight of the input vector of a very small part of the dimension non-zero, that is to say, when the model is online, the volume of the model is very small, which is undoubtedly beneficial to the entire model serving process. Both the memory space required to store the model and the speed of online inference will benefit from the sparsity of the model. If the SGD method is used to update the model, it is easier to generate a large number of features with small weights than the batch method, which increases the difficulty of model deployment and update. So in order to take into account the training effect and model sparsity in the online learning process, there are a lot of related researches. The most famous ones include Microsoft\'s RDA, Google\'s FOBOS and the most famous FTRL, etc.\\n4. **Partial model update** - Another improvement direction to improve the real-time performance of the model is to perform a partial update of the model. The general idea is to reduce the update frequency of the part with low training efficiency and increase the update frequency of the part with high training efficiency . This approach is representative of the GBDT+LR model of Facebook.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled.png)\\n\\n## Data pipeline of a typical news recommendation system\\n\\nWhen a user is exposed with a list of news articles, a page view events are sent to the backend server and when that user clicks on the news of interest, the action events are also sent to the backend server. After receiving these 2 event streams (page view and clicks), the backend server will send these user behaviour events to the message queue. And message queue finally stores these messages into the distributed file system, such as HDFS.\\n\\nFor model training, we need a training sample. The most common sampling technique is negative sampling. In this, we generate \'n\' negative samples for each positive event that we receive. Users will only generate behavior for some exposed news samples, which are positive samples, and the remaining exposure samples without behavior are negative samples. After generating positive and negative samples, the model can be trained.\\n\\nThe recommendation system with low real-time requirements can use batch processing technology (APACHE spark is a typical tool) to generate samples, as shown in the left figure. Set a timing task, and read the user behavior log and exposure log in the time window from HDFS every other period of time, such as one hour, to perform join operation, generate training samples, and then write the training samples back to HDFS, Then start the training update of the model.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled-1.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled-1.png)\\n\\n### Problems\\n\\nOne obvious problem with batch processing is **latency**. The typical cycle of running batch tasks regularly is one hour, which means that there is a delay of at least one hour from sample generation to model training. Sometimes, if the batch platform is overloaded and the tasks need to be queued, the delay will be greater.\\n\\nAnother problem is the **boundary** problem. If page view (PV) data is generated at the end of the log time window selected by the batch task, the corresponding action data may fall into the next time window of the batch task, resulting in join failure and false negative samples.\\n\\nA related problem to this is the time synchronization problem. When a news item is exposed to the user, the user may click immediately after the PV data stream is generated, or the user may act after a few minutes, more than ten minutes, or even several hours. This means that after the PV data stream arrives, it needs to wait for a period of time to join with the action data stream. If the waiting time is too long, some samples (positive samples) that should have user behavior will be wrongly marked as negative samples because the user behavior has no time to return. Too long waiting time will damage and increase the system delay. Offline analysis of the delay distribution between the actual action data stream and PV data stream is a very typical exponential distribution.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled-2.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-real-time-news-personalization-with-flink-untitled-2.png)\\n\\n## Apache Flink to the rescue\\n\\n### How Apache Flink solves the latency problem?\\n\\nIn order to enhance the real-time performance, we use Apache Flink framework to rewrite the sample generation logic with stream processing technology. As shown in the right figure above, after the user exposure and behavior logs generated by online services are written into the message queue, instead of waiting for them to drop to HDFS, we directly consume these message flows with Flink. At the same time, Flink reads the necessary feature information from the redis cache and generates the sample message stream directly. The sample message flow is written back to the Kafka queue, and downstream tensorflow can directly consume the message flow for model training.\\n\\n### How Apache Flink solved the boundary and synchronization problem?\\n\\nAs per the exponential distribution (analyzed on a private dataset of a news recommender app), most of the user behavior has reflow within a few minutes. And if few minutes is an acceptable delay, a simple solution is to set a time window with a compromise size. Flink provides window join to implement this logic.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

However, manually selecting the background music becomes a painstaking task due to the voluminous and ever-growing pool of candidate music. Therefore, automatically recommending background music to videos becomes an important task.\\n\\nIn [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07268.pdf) paper, Zhu et. al. shared their approach to solve this task. They first collected ~3,000 background music from popular TikTok videos and also ~150,000 video clips that used some kind of background music. They named this dataset `TT-150K`.\\n\\n![An exemplar subset of videos and their matched background music in the established TT-150k dataset](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-short-video-background-music-recommender-untitled.png)\\n\\nAn exemplar subset of videos and their matched background music in the established TT-150k dataset\\n\\nAfter building the dataset, they worked on modeling and proposed the following architecture:\\n\\n![Proposed CMVAE (Cross-modal Variational Auto-encoder) framework](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-short-video-background-music-recommender-untitled-1.png)\\n\\nProposed CMVAE (Cross-modal Variational Auto-encoder) framework\\n\\nThe goal is to represent videos (`users` in recsys terminology) and music (`items`) in a shared latent space. To achieve this, CMVAE use pre-trained models to extract features from unstructured data - `vggish` model for audio2vec, `resnet` for video2vec and `bert-multilingual` for text2vec.  Text and video vectors are then fused using product-of-expert approach. \\n\\nIt uses the reconstruction power of variational autoencoders to 1) reconstruct video from music latent vector and, 2) reconstruct music from video latent vector. In layman terms, we are training a neural network that will try to guess the video activity just by listening background music, and also try to guess the background music just by seeing the video activities. \\n\\nThe joint training objective is $\\\\mathcal{L}_{(z_m,z_v)} = \\\\beta \\\\cdot\\\\mathcal{L}_{cross\\\\_recon} - \\\\mathcal{L}_{KL} + \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}_{matching}$, where $\\\\beta$ and $\\\\gamma$ control the weight of the cross reconstruction loss and the matching loss, respectively.\\n\\nAfter training the model, they compared the model\'s performance with existing baselines and the results are as follows:\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-short-video-background-music-recommender-untitled-2.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-short-video-background-music-recommender-untitled-2.png)\\n\\n**Conclusion**: I don\'t make short videos myself but can easily imagine the difficulty in finding the right background music. If I have to do this task manually, I will try out 5-6 videos and select one that I like. But here, I will be assuming that my audience would also like this music. Moreover, feedback is not actionable because it will create kind of an implicit sub-conscious effect (because when I see a video, I mostly judge it at overall level and rarely notice that background music is the problem). So, this kind of recommender system will definitely help me in selecting a better background music. Excited to see this feature soon in TikTok, Youtube Shorts and other similar services."},{"id":"/2021/10/01/the-progression-of-analytics-in-enterprises","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/the-progression-of-analytics-in-enterprises","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-the-progression-of-analytics-in-enterprises.mdx","title":"The progression of analytics in enterprises","description":"An organization\u2019s analytics strategy is how its\xa0people, processes, tools, and data\xa0work together to collect, store, and analyze data.

During this phase, organizations were able to consolidate mostly transactional data into a unified system, often a\xa0data warehouse, which limited end users\u2019 ability to interact directly with the data due to technical and governance requirements. | Starting in the late 2000s, organizations were forced to rethink how they used analytics, in no small part due to the explosion of data during this time. This was the era of \u201cBig Data\u201d and its infamous\xa0\u201c V\u2019s\u201d:\xa0volume, velocity, and variety.4\xa0As organizations shifted their approach during this period, they unlocked\xa0diagnostic analytics, or the capability to answer \u201cWhy did it happen?\u201d | The Future of Analytics Is Converged. Converged analytics unifies advances in AI, streaming data, and related technologies into a seamless analytics experience for all users. This arrangement unlocks\xa0prescriptive\xa0analytics across an organization, allowing anyone to make data-driven decisions that answer important questions. |\\n| People | IT professionals were needed to kick off any data-based work by extracting data from a centralized, difficult-to-use source. This process could take multiple days, and the number of query requests could easy exceed the IT team\u2019s ability to fulfill those requests\u2014and the opportune time for new insights.If some change was needed to data collection or storage methods, it could easily take IT months to perform. The data analysis and modeling work could take nearly as long. Rank-and-file domain experts did have\xa0some\xa0access to data, through so-called\xa0self-service business intelligence (BI)\xa0features. However, due to the same speed and accessibility issues that technical professionals faced, it was often difficult for domain experts like line of business leaders to truly lead with data for decision making. | It\u2019s no coincidence that around the same time as Big Data emerged, so did the role of the\xa0data scientist. Compared with earlier roles like researcher or statistician, the data scientist blends quantitative and domain expertise with a greater degree of computational thinking. These skills became necessary both to handle the greater variety and volume of data sources and to update and deploy data and analytics models without the assistance of IT professionals.Whereas IT in the past sought to meticulously catalog and structure data to enter into a data warehouse, they no longer needed to always clean the data before collecting it; these analytics teams could focus on ease of use and speed to governed access.With these new workflows and organization structures in place, domain leaders are better able to lead with data: both via self-service BI tools and from frequent collaboration with data analysts, data scientists, and other data specialists. | Statisticians and IT served information to business users at the inception of a wider analytics adoption; further into maturity, data analysts and scientists built systems where business users could self-serve insights. In a converged architecture, not only is the business user at the center, but their decision making is augmented by automation. Given this arrangement, there is more collaboration, more automation, and greater scale for data-driven insights as a result of the convergence of teams and workstreams. Teams can work cross-functionally and in parallel across different domains iterating the system to their needs with the raw time and human resources needed to create and maintain analytics products such as dashboards and models. |\\n| Processes | IT professionals spent long periods of time gathering requirements for analytics projects before they could build or deploy solutions. The team meticulously catalogued sources of data used across the organization, from financial or point-of-sale systems to frequently used external datasets. As part of the warehousing process, it was decided\xa0which\xa0of these data sources to store and\xa0how\xa0to store them.Once deployed, data passed into the warehouse through an\xa0extract-transform-load\xa0process (ETL), where the data was copied from these various sources, cleaned and reshaped into the defined structure of the data warehouse, then inserted into production. In other words, data went through rigorous cleaning and preprocessing\xa0before\xa0use.To reach this data, users needed to write time-consuming ad hoc queries. Alternatively, particular data segments or summaries that were frequently requested by business users could be delivered via scheduled automation to reports, dashboards, and scorecards. | As opposed to earlier analytics strategies, IT professionals now seek to collect data as is from any possible source of value. This data can be in a variety of formats, so few predefined rules or relationships are established for ingestion. Depending on the data size, data is processed in batch over discrete time periods, or in streams and events near real time. Because data cleaning is the last step, this process is sometimes referred to as\xa0extract-load-transform\xa0(ELT), as opposed to the ETL of earlier architectures. For data scientists and other technical professionals, faster access to more\xa0and more dynamic\xa0data better enables the rapid development of training sets of data for machine learning models. The ELT process allows for the construction of\xa0machine learning\xa0models, where computers are able to improve performance as more data is passed to them.As more data is collected and put into production, the importance of a\xa0data governance\xa0process typically grows, describing who has authority over data and how that data should be used. Similar approaches are necessary to audit how models are put into production and how they work. | While perhaps using different\xa0means, the\xa0ends\xa0of older analytics approaches were the same: insights, whether historic or in support of future decisions, using governed data and processes. In the methods for doing so, however, infrastructure tended to bloat, either from fragile data storage jobs or increasingly complex data pipelines.Given the volume, velocity, and variety of data needed for prescriptive analytics, such monolithic, centralized approaches are less than optimal. Using the tools discussed in the next section, a converged architecture offers a more nimble approach for providing the right insights at the right time to users of all technical levels.Such democratization relies on quick deployment and adjustment of data products; optimizing production, for example, requires bringing more machine learning models to production faster and at scale. The practice of\xa0ModelOps\xa0is used to institute and govern such rapid production. These processes have become a necessity in rapidly changing business conditions; for example, as the COVID-19 pandemic made structural changes to the economy, many models lost their predictive edge in the face of fundamentally different data. |\\n| Tools | Data warehouses implemented some new technologies relative to the traditional relational database model. Importantly, the data warehouse separated data into\xa0fact\xa0tables, where measurements were stored, and\xa0dimension\xa0tables, which contained descriptive attributes. Business users interacted with the data via reporting software to view static data summaries. These tended to rely on overnight batch jobs to update.In a more sophisticated architecture, analysts could take advantage of\xa0online analytical processing\xa0(OLAP) cubes. Usually relying on a star schema, OLAP let users query the data across dimensions during interactive sessions. For example, they could \u201cslice and dice\u201d or \u201croll up and drill down\u201d on the data.By this point, end users had some autonomy in how they looked at and acted upon the data. Automated processes to inform business activities through data were also put into place, such as alerts when inventory or sales dropped below some threshold. Basic what-if analyses also helped business users evaluate decisions and plan for the future.That said, given the limited sources of data from the data warehouse, there were limited ways to customize and work with the data. While reporting and basic analytics were automated, end users operated largely without the assistance of models developed by\xa0statisticians. Although business intelligence and operations research seek to create value from data, too often these complementary tools were siloed. | In 2011, James Dixon, then chief technology officer of Pentaho, coined the term\xa0data lake\xa0as the architecture needed to support the next level of analytics maturity.\xa0Dixon argued that because of the inherently rigid structures of data warehouses, getting value from the increasing volume and variety of data associated with Big Data was difficult. A data lake, \u201ca repository of data stored in its natural/raw format,\u201d was a better approach. In particular, this arrangement wasn\u2019t suited to operate or capitalize on the expanding volume and variety of Big Data.The data lake is often powered by cloud computing for the benefits of reliability, redundancy, and scalability. Dominant cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Open source technologies like Hadoop and Spark are used to process and store massive datasets using parallel computing and distributed storage. Because this data is often unstructured, it may be stored in graph, document, or other non-relational databases.With the increasing volume and velocity of data, and the use of data lakes along with data warehouses to enable data-driven decisions, businesses needed better ways to scale and share business intelligence. One such path was through interactive, immersive exploration and visualization of the data, as pioneered with Spotfire. Other paths were through visual reports and dashboards, as used by not just Spotfire, but by Jaspersoft, Power BI, WebFOCUS, and many others. As BI tools matured, self-service capabilities and automation for end users also matured. | If maintaining legacy analytics is like raising a thoroughbred, then developing converged analytics is like cultivating a school of goldfish. That is, the backend provisioning is no longer served by monolithic systems but rather by composable groups of\xa0microservices. This arrangement supports elastic and scalable analytics; composability makes it easier to adapt to changes driven in part by a growing volume and variety of data sources. In previous analytics approaches, the distinction between backward-facing BI and prediction-focused data science was clear. Under convergence, analytics at the edge is possible\u2014automating analytic computations so they can be performed on non-centralized data generated by sensors, switches, and similar. With converged analytics, individuals no longer need to wait for data science teams to provide ad hoc deeper insights. They have all the data-driven insights at their fingertips, assisted by AI to quickly explore and make decisions. This isn\u2019t just the case for back-office analysts: frontline workers can, for example, adjust how they interact with a customer given data retrieved about that customer at the time of that interaction. |\\n| Data | During this period, data tended to be\xa0transactional, or related to sales and purchases. Take a point-of-sales (POS) system, for example. Each time a sale is made, information about what was sold,\xa0possibly\xa0to whom, is recorded in the POS system. Those records can be compiled into tables and ultimately processed into a data\xa0warehouse.Under this process, data is gathered from prespecified sources at prespecified times, such as a nightly POS extract. Not all data made its way to the data warehouse, especially in the earlier days of analytics\u2014either because it was judged unimportant, or because it was not prioritized. | Contemporary analytics expands the variety of data available and used: both\xa0structured\xa0tables and\xa0unstructured\xa0sources like natural language and images are available. On account of stream processing, refreshes of this data are available in minutes or even less. In particular, the data lake can accommodate real-time events such as IoT sensor readings, GPS signals, and online transactions as they\xa0happen. | A primary feature of converged analytics is the blending of historical and real-time data. According to a study by Seagate and International Data Corporation (IDC), 30% of all data will be real time by 2025. In particular, IoT sensor readings, GPS signals, and online transactions as they happen are available for immediate analysis and modeling. |\\n| Agility | The relatively rigid nature of the data warehouse made changes to the collection and dissemination of data difficult. Subsequently, business agility was limited. Business users could get historic data about the business through static reports (descriptive analytics). Through OLAP cubes, they could possibly even dig into the data to parse out cause and effect (diagnostic analytics). But without more immediate access to broader data, it was difficult to advance to\xa0predictive analytics, or the ability to ask: \u201cWhat is\xa0going\xa0to happen?\u201d | This next phase in the evolution of analytics gets data-driven insights into the hands of end users quickly, with technology allowing them to interact with it on a deeper level. Data scientists are able to build machine learning systems that improve with more data. Using drag-and-drop tools, business users can process and analyze data without technical assistance. With cloud, automation, and streaming technologies, organizations have been better able to adapt to and plan for changing circumstances. That said, machine learning works only so long in production before the algorithm struggles to account for changes to the business and needs intervention. While data scientists undertake these predictive challenges, BI professionals and domain experts tend to operate solely in analyzing current or past data. The next generation of analytics architecture will further reflect organizational needs for greater collaboration among data scientists, BI and analytics teams, and business users and consumers of analytics insights. | Earlier analytics tended to isolate skills and processes: technical versus highly technical roles, data collection versus deployment versus modeling, and so forth. Converged analytics promotes close collaboration between teams to rapidly model, deploy, and act on data. As data operations become decentralized, teams and individuals can rapidly mine and act on the analytics.In particular, the marriage of real-time data with machine learning and AI-infused BI allows any user to magnify their own domain knowledge with data-driven insights. These features square precisely with the definition of business agility as \u201cinnovation via collaboration to be able to anticipate challenges and opportunities before they occur.\u201d With the support of converged analytics, any professional can detect and act on both challenges and opportunities at the moment of impact, rather than months later. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n\xa9\ufe0f2021, RecoHut."},{"id":"/2021/10/01/tools-for-building-recommender-systems","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/tools-for-building-recommender-systems","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-tools-for-building-recommender-systems.mdx","title":"Tools for building recommender systems","description":"/img/content-blog-raw-blog-tools-for-building-recommender-systems-untitled.png","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"recsys","permalink":"/blog/tags/recsys"},{"label":"tool","permalink":"/blog/tags/tool"}],"readingTime":11.025,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sparsh Agarwal","title":"Data Scientist & Engineer","url":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai","email":"sprsag@gmail.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/sparsh-ai.png","key":"sparsh"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tools for building recommender systems","authors":"sparsh","tags":["recsys","tool"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The progression of analytics in enterprises","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/the-progression-of-analytics-in-enterprises"},"nextItem":{"title":"Vehicle Suggestions","permalink":"/blog/2021/10/01/vehicle-suggestions"}},"content":"![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-tools-for-building-recommender-systems-untitled.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-tools-for-building-recommender-systems-untitled.png)\\n\\n## Recombee - Recommendation as a service API\\n\\nRecombee is a Recommender as a Service with easy integration and Admin UI.

Actions are the content items, such as news articles, specific movies, or products. It takes a list of items (e.g. list of drop-down choices) and their context (e.g. Report Name, User Name, Time Zone) as input and returns the ranked list of items for the given context. While doing that, it also allows feedback submission regarding the relevance and efficiency of the ranking results returned by the service. The feedback (reward score) can be automatically calculated and submitted to the service based on the given personalization use case.\\n\\n![/img/content-blog-raw-blog-tools-for-building-recommender-systems-untitled-4.png](/img/content-blog-raw-blog-tools-for-building-recommender-systems-untitled-4.png)\\n\\nYou can use the Personalizer service to determine what product to suggest to shoppers or to figure out the optimal position for an advertisement. After the content is shown to the user, your application monitors the user\'s reaction and reports a reward score back to the Personalizer service. This ensures continuous improvement of the machine learning model, and Personalizer\'s ability to select the best content item based on the contextual information it receives. \\n\\nFollowing are some of the interesting use cases of Azure Personalizer:\\n\\n1.

News Recommendation\\n5. Movie Recommendation\\n6. Product Recommendation\\n7. **Intent clarification & disambiguation**: help your users have a better experience when their intent is not clear by providing an option that is personalized.\\n8. **Default suggestions**\xa0for menus & options: have the bot suggest the most likely item in a personalized way as a first step, instead of presenting an impersonal menu or list of alternatives.\\n9. **Bot traits & tone**: for bots that can vary tone, verbosity, and writing style, consider varying these traits.\\n10. **Notification & alert content**: decide what text to use for alerts in order to engage users more.\\n11. **Notification & alert timing**: have personalized learning of when to send notifications to users to engage them more.\\n12. Dropdown Options - Different users of an application with manager privileges would see a list of reports that they can run. Before Personalizer was implemented, the list of dozens of reports was displayed in alphabetical order, requiring most of the managers to scroll through the lengthy list to find the report they needed. This created a poor user experience for daily users of the reporting system, making for a good use case for Personalizer. The tooling learned from the user behavior and began to rank frequently run reports on the top of the dropdown list. Frequently run reports would be different for different users, and would change over time for each manager as they get assigned to different projects.

Extract PM2.5 data from [openaq.org](http://openaq.org) using Selenium Scrapy\\n\\n:::note Scrapy vs. Selenium\\n\\nSelenium is an automation tool for testing web applications. It uses a webdriver as an interface to control webpages through programming languages. So, this gives Selenium the capability to handle dynamic webpages effectively. Selenium is capable of extracting data on its own. It is true, but it has its caveats. Selenium cannot handle large data, but Scrapy can handle large data with ease. Also, Selenium is much slower when compared to Scrapy. So, the smart choice would be to use Selenium with Scrapy to scrape dynamic webpages containing large data, consuming less time. Combining Selenium with Scrapy is a simpler process. All that needs to be done is let Selenium render the webpage and once it is done, pass the webpage\u2019s source to create a Scrapy Selector object. And from here on, Scrapy can crawl the page with ease and effectively extract a large amount of data.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n```python\\n# SKELETON FOR COMBINING SELENIUM WITH SCRAPY\\nfrom scrapy import Selector\\n# Other Selenium and Scrapy imports\\n...\\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\\n# Selenium tasks and actions to render the webpage with required content\\nselenium_response_text = driver.page_source\\nnew_selector = Selector(text=selenium_response_text)\\n# Scrapy tasks to extract data from Selector\\n```\\n\\n## Project tree\\n\\n```html\\n.\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

In the Amazon Live case, the stream occupies the most of the screen space.\\n2. **The list of products being promoted**, with the product currently being shown highlighted. This list appears at the bottom of the Amazon video stream.\\n3. **A chat area,**\xa0where viewers can type questions and comments to interact with the host and other viewers. The chat area is at the right of the live stream on Amazon Live.\\n4. **A reaction button, that users**\xa0can use to send reactions, displayed as animated emojis. The reaction button shows up as a little star icon at the bottom right of the video stream on Amazon.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n1.
