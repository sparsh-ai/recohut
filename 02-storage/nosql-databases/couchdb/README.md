# Apache CouchDB

Apache CouchDB is an open source [NoSQL](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/cloud-database "cloud-database") document database that collects and stores data in JSON-based document formats. Unlike relational databases, CouchDB uses a schema-free data model, which simplifies record management across various computing devices, mobile phones, and web browsers.

CouchDB was introduced in 2005 and later became an Apache Software Foundation project in 2008. As an open source project, CouchDB is supported by an active community of developers who continuously improve the software with a focus on ease of use and embracing the web.
