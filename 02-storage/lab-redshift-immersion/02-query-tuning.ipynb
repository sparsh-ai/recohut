    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of themes when looking at query performance on Redshift:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about table Distribution and Sort keys and how they affect queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the table is architected will impact how Redshift is able to leverage query plans and so keeping that in mind can help you effectively define tables and query them. Knowing what your Distribution keys and Sort Keys are when joining tables can help you write better queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grander point is to keep access patterns in mind when architecting tables. Before making optimization decisions, think about the data volume (result set size), query frequency, and downstream impact of optimizing towards those operations. If you don’t have a clear vision of all access patterns, start with DIST STYLE EVEN, and build a baseline of access patterns on your cluster to optimize against.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Result Set does not equal table size\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because your table is giant, doesn’t necessarily mean that the results you are extracting out (or the data being scanned) is giant. Often in EDWs we are actually just pulling out the latest week or month’s data. In terms of query optimization, think in terms of how much data you are reading, not the total size of the table. Keep in mind sort keys and the columnar architecture in how it can make query more effective in reading data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make big things small early\n",
    "\n",
    "When possible, filter data as early as possible in your query. If you only need a month of data, don’t pass the entire table around until the very end. While this takes some effort upfront in the query writing process, habit such as this will help ensure you are utilizing the cluster in a more efficient manner."
